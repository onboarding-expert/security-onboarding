# Tutorial: Passwords and Policies 

## Why Are Passwords So Important?

Passwords are like the keys to your digital life. They protect your accounts (email, social media, banking) and your devices (phones, laptops) from unauthorized access. A weak or reused password is like leaving your front door unlocked â€“ it makes it easy for intruders to get in.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Creating and managing strong passwords is crucial:

*   **Length is Strength:** Aim for passwords that are at least 12-15 characters long. The longer, the better!
*   **Complexity Matters:** Mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like `!@#$%^&*`). Avoid common words, names, or easily guessable sequences (like `password123` or `qwerty`).
*   **Uniqueness is Key:** Use a *different* password for *every* important account. If one account is compromised, using unique passwords prevents attackers from accessing your other accounts.
*   **Use a Password Manager:** Remembering dozens of long, complex, unique passwords is hard! A password manager is a secure tool that generates strong passwords, stores them safely, and can automatically fill them in for you. Examples include Bitwarden, 1Password, and LastPass.
*   **Follow Policies:** If your workplace or school has specific password rules (like changing passwords periodically or minimum complexity requirements), make sure to follow them.
