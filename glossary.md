*   **Cybersecurity:** The practice of protecting computer systems, networks, devices, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.
*   **Data Interception:** When an unauthorized party captures data being transmitted over a network (often a risk on unsecured public Wi-Fi).
*   **Encryption:** The process of scrambling data so it can only be read by authorized parties who have the correct key or password.
*   **Ethernet:** A common way to connect devices to a network using a physical cable.

*   **Public Wi-Fi:** Wireless networks available in public places like cafes, airports, or libraries, often less secure than private networks.
*   **Screen lock:** A security feature that requires authentication (like a PIN, password, pattern, or biometric) to access a device after it has been idle or turned on.
*   **Secure Lock / Smart Lock:** Android features that can keep a device unlocked in trusted environments (e.g., at home) but require the lock screen elsewhere.
*   **Secure network:** A network protected with security measures like strong passwords and encryption (e.g., your home Wi-Fi).
*   **Security Updates:** Software updates released by manufacturers to fix known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities.
*   **Timeout (Screen Lock):** The period of inactivity after which a device's screen automatically locks.
